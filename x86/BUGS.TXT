Wrap_Line = 0   don't work very well. It works with elvis or talk on linux
                but messes up bash at last line
                You can't really change this options from telnet> prompt
                It is only for the start up.

Enable_Mouse=1  Causes the display to slow in fullscreen mode, since the
                mouse has to be erased and then drawn again for every
                screen write.

Term_Width or Term_Height != -1 or Wide_Enable=1
                Specifying any of these can cause display problems if
                the font size is not set to auto (Win95/98).
