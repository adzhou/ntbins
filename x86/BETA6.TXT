Moving from beta5 to beta6

There are a couple of differences between beta5 and beta6 that you might
want to be aware of.

First of all is the way that beta6 handles blink and underline.  A Windows
console can't display these under normal circumstances.  While beta5 tried
to display them with high intensity backgrounds, beta6 tries to display
them with colors.  Unfortunately, the emulation isn't complete (hopefully
it will be in beta7).  So, if you want to use colors for blink and underline,
put the following lines in telnet.ini:

[Colors]
blink_fg = 2
underline_fg = 3
ulblink_fg = 1

Otherwise, set the values to -1 to disable colors (and telnet will try to
use high intensity backgrounds for blink and underline).

Also, beta6 now has mouse support!  It is enabled by default, but if you
like to run Console Telnet in full-screen, you might want to disable it
since it can slow some things down.  To do this, simply put
enable_mouse=0 in the [Mouse] section of telnet.ini.

If you want to be able to display ASCII characters below 32, you can now do
that, though you will sacrifice a little bit of speed.  To enable this
feature, put fast_write=0 in the [Terminal] section of telnet.ini.  Or, to
to ensure that output is as fast as it can be, make sure that fast_write
is not set to 0.

Finally, there are some changes to the scrollback mode.  You can change the
default mode for scrollback with Scroll_Mode (in the [Scrollback] section
of telnet.ini).  You can then change the scroll mode on-the-fly with the
tab key while you are in scrollback mode.  See options.txt for more
details.

That's essentially the sum of the most important new features in console
telnet.  If you have any problems, or questions, please email the mailing
list, telnet-win32@argeas.cs-net.gr, or me at pbranna@clemson.edu.
Console telnet is a group effort, and thanks goes to everyone who's helped
(and to everyone who's posted bug reports)!  Keep up the good work!
